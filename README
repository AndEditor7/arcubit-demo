The Arcubit first prototype build being rewite/remasted in progress. The code are messy because it still not finish!

The video of this game before the rewite: https://youtu.be/p3Hm1wfeOP4

----Inputs----
Esc - Exit the game without saving the world.
WASD - Player movement.
F - Toggle fly mode.
L - Reload the chunk and lighting.
/ - Open the command line.
1(One) - Shot the TNT.
F4 - Open the save world.
Mouse left click  - Breaks block.
Mouse right click - Places block.
Mouse scroll wheel - select block.

----ChangeLog----
###Performance and Stability Update###: #Runnable.

Performances:
- Rework how chunks mesh/vertex stored to reduce video memory usage (v-ram). (from 32 to 24 bytes per vertex, saves 8 bytes) #Done
- Index buffer is no longer recreated per new chunk mesh, Index buffer is now shared for all chunk meshes. (reduce video memory usage, faster mesh building, and efficient rendering) #Done
- Move meshes from chunk to render table for efficient rendering. #Done
- Improved chunk mesh-builder for slightly efficient. #Done
- Added asynchronous chunk loading to reduce the workload for rendering thread (Improve FPS when loading new chunks) #Done
- Implement chunks update queue to reduce checking for a new chunk to update. #Done
- Get and set blocks are now faster. #Done
- Reduce blocks updates per frame from 200 to 150. #Done
- Optimized frustum culling for chunks. #Done
- Optimized clouds - both rendering and noise. #Done
- Optimized particles. Particles are now pooled to reuse 'dead' Particles. #Working on
- Optimized world generator. #Working on
- Added VBO option to disable/enable VBO rendering. For better performance for GPU that shares a memory from the system (like integrated GPU), than disable the VBO, else enable VBO if GPU has own memory like v-ram. #Working on
- Rework the save system to reuse data buffer. The recreating data buffer on every saves may cause a memory leak. - Working on

Additional:
- Added option before launching the game. The new option includes fullscreen mode(on/off), VBO rendering(on/off), new world gen option (Hilly land or flat land), and more. #Working on
- Added Hilly land world gen for in option (From 3rd Arcubit game) #Working on
- Added some more blocks #Working on

Changes:
- Update the LibGDX from 1.9.10 to 1.9.11 #Done
- Update the LWJGL from 2.9.3 to 3.2.3 #Done
- Water and plants are no longer shares mesh (both has own mesh and shader) #Done
- Tweak some textures. #Working on
- Biomes are warped and a bit bigger. #Working on
- Improved block ray-cast. #Working on
- Rewrite more than haft the game codes. #Working on
- Code clean up. #Almost Done

Fixes:
- Fixed crash on start-up from invalided shader(s) on some GPU. #Done
- Fixed Z depth buffer precision loss. #Done
- Fixed Incorrect ambient occlusion on 'top face block'. #Done
- Fixed slow movement when the player looks up or down while moving. #Done

Note: This game is the first prototype build of a voxel engine. It's very unstable.
